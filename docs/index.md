software that hasn't changed much in 30 years. Why? I use the command line
because it is powerful and expressive and because all the other tools I use work
well with it. But at the same time it seems we ought be able to improve on the
interface while keeping the fundamental idea.

Smash is an attempt to improve the textual user interface while preserving the
the good parts. Reasonable people can disagree over what exactly that means. If
this whole idea makes you upset please see the first question in the
[FAQ](faq.md).
